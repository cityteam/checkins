                The first person comes up and says his name is <em>Barney Rubble</em>
                (no real names in this example!).  It is important to see if this
                Guest has stayed at this Facility before.  Let's search all previous
                Guests to see if we can find a match.  You can search on any set of
                letters within the name (upper case or lower case does not matter).
                So, let's search for <strong>ub</strong> and see what we get.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you type each character, the list of matches will change.  If there
                are two many matches for one page, the pagination controls
                (<strong>&lt;</strong> or <strong>&gt;</strong>) will light up,
                allowing you to page through the various matches.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also search for part of the first name OR part of the last name,
                by typing a space between the arts.  For example, <strong>ar ub</strong>
                would also find this person.
            </p>
            <p>
                We see that Barney has checked in here before, so click his name
                to complete the assignment.

                The first two fields, Payment Type and Payment Amount, are required.  The
                Payment Type field indicates whether the person is paying in cash ($$), or
                for whatever other reason (see the dropdown for options) they do not have
                to pay tonight.  The payment amount defaults to $5 because that is what
                CityTeam Portland currently requests -- erase it if this person is not
                paying.

                You can also optionally enter a time this person wants to take a shower,
                or just gets woken up in the morning.  Use HH:MM or HH:MM:SS format
                for these.  You can also add a comment like <em>Will arrive from work
                after 10:00</em> if needed.

                Back at the <em>Manage Checkins</em> page, we see that this Guest
                has indeed been assigned to Mat 2, and the totals at the bottom have
                been updated.  This will occur every time a change is made.  The
                <em>Total $$</em> amount is also useful in checking how much cash
                was actually received, versus what you expected.

                If you need a hard copy of the checkin information at the end of the

                Now, the next person (Fred Flintstone) is ready to check in, and we
                wish to assign him to mat number 4.

                Click anywhere on the row for mat 4, and search using <strong>fred</strong>

                But this time, we do not find him - this is the first time he has checked in
