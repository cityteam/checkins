Welcome to the regular user documentation for the CityTeam Guests Checkin
Application!  It is people like you who make the whole process work smoothly,
so thank you for being involved!

This is the first of several pages of helpful information, organized in the
order these steps are usually taken.  You'll see a cheat sheet like the one
just below, to give you quick access to a particular step, at the top of each
page.

If you are interested in the additional information related to an
administrative user (who can manage additional features related to
the CityTeam Facility you have access to), click on the
Help --> Administrative User navigation link , or just click

Note that the application now knows who you are, and that you have been
granted access to the Portland facility at CityTeam.  If your username
has been granted access to more than one facility, the dropdown in the
upper right corner can be used to select which one you want to work
on at the moment, and can be changed at any time.
