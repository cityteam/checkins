This is the **regular-user.md** file.

The admin user stuff is [here](/help/admin-user.md).

The regular user login screen:

![Initial Screen](/helptext/both-initial.png)

To log in, click the ![Login Button Top](/helptext/button-login-top.png)
button, and enter your username and password.

![Login Dialog Start](/helptext/regular-login-start.png)

Now press ![Login Button](/helptext/button-login.png) and you will be
ready to go, with the menu looking like this:

![Login Dialog Finish](/helptext/regular-login-finish.png)

Note that the application now knows who you are, and that you have been
granted access to the Portland facility at CityTeam.  If your username
has been granted access to more than one facility, the dropdown in the
upper right corner can be used to select which one you want to work
on at the moment, and can be changed at any time.
