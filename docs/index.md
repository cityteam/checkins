# CityTeam Checkins Application

Welcome to the CityTeam Checkins Application, designed to assist CityTeam
Facilities in checking overnight Guests into a CityTeam Facility.

[CityTeam](https://cityteam.org) offers programs for outreach to, and
support of homeless communities, as well as recovery from addition,
in several US cities.  See their website for more information.

The information covered is targeted for different user types, with
separate pages customized to your needs:
* [I need to check in Guests](./USER.md).  This is the primary function
  of this application, where you register each individual and assign
  them a mat (or other sleeping arrangement).
* [I need to administer the Facility and its related information](./ADMIN.md). 
  Your username and password will provide access to additional features that
  let you set up the required information for your CityTeam Facility, 
  as well as edit information about each Guest that has ever checked in.
* [I need to install the application locally](./INSTALL.md).  Our Facility
  prefers to run the application on our local network, instead of using
  a version on the Internet.  See also an empty
  [Cheat Sheet](./CHEATSHEET.md) on which you can record configuration
  information as you perform the installation.
* [I need to work on the software that drives this application](./DEVELOP.md).
  The source code for the entire application is open source, and available
  [at GitHub](https://cityteam.github.com/checkins).  You will need to install
  a local version (see the [installation instructions](./INSTALL.md) and
  then the extra information found here.
